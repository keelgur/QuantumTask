# Soil erosion detection
Test task given by Quantum: data classification, model scripting, building and reporting on solution
## Installation
To install requirements, please use PyPi accordingly
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Problems
Task isn't completed, because of: changes and deprecations in needed modules(libraries), CRS in given data(JP2 image) is unknown(even tries to take it from proj4 file or hardcoding are failing after masking).
Therefore, scripting with keras or tf isn't done yet.
